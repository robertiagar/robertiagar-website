Now that the design and pages are finally looking like a wanted them to look, I can't wait to hear what you guys think about it. [Disqus][disqus] is enabled and works, I've got a good github workflow and everything works great. Each modification I make, I'm making it on a new commit and create a pull request for it, wait for [Codeship.io][codeship] to validate it and then merge it into the `gh-pages` branch. I'll make a blog post later explaining how I manage and built everything from scratch. 

It took me a while, but I decided to "try it out" and I'm pleased with the result.
