<p>have you ever been struggling hours on end to try and make something work? well I have today been trying to make a stupid thing to update for the past 3 hours and I finally managed to make it work. there’s still work to be done, but I’m on the way to glory. finally the end may be in sight. this project has given me all sorts of issues, but I got it to a decent degree. can’t wait to finish it, while hoping that maintenance won’t be such a drag.</p> <p>finally I can go to bed and hope that tomorrow I’ll work out the kinks and have a working thing by the end of the week (famous last words)…</p> <p>either way, enjoy the mix that help me through. you can thank Going Quantum by subscribing to his podcast at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/goingquantum">YouTube</a>:</p> <p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVYSxD5JWa0]</p>
