I've started work on my website. So far so good. I haven't quite figure out what will be on it, but I have a general idea where I'm going with it. I'll be making a custom blog and RSS just to learn how to create a .NET Blog. I know there are framework already out there that do this, but I want to do this for myself. How hard can it be?<br /><br />The site will also function as an online resume and will feature all my personal projects or project ideas that I had, have and going to have in the future. I'm not sharing my work so far. Not until I'm happy with the overall design and features.<br /><br />In the mean time, I've posted some new photographs over at <a href="http://500px.com/RobertIagar">500px</a>. The one below is my favorite.<br /><br /><a href="http://500px.com/photo/58003828">  <img alt="attention by Robert Iagar on 500px.com" border="0" src="http://ppcdn.500px.org/58003828/7d9675ff3423430ab0aa3c5bc87f264f6d233be1/4.jpg" /></a><br /><span style="font-size:120%;">  <a href="http://500px.com/photo/58003828">attention</a>  by   <a href="http://500px.com/RobertIagar">Robert Iagar</a></span><br />Enjoy and until next time, signing off...
