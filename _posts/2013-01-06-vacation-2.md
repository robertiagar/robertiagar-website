So this is it. Vacation has come to an end. It feels like it started yesterday. I don't want school or work to start. I do miss my coworkers though. I'll miss my friends even more. We had a great New Years party. It sucks that we have to be in two different cities, but then again that's what makes us special. That might be the thing that holds us together. Or might end up to be the thing that drives us apart. I don't really know. I'm glad that I have them as friends and I'll enjoy every second I've got with them...
