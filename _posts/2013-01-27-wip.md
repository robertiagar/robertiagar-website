I sat these days and I wondered: why I am rushing to get out there? I mean school should be the most important thing to finish right now. Yet I feel that it's a huge waste of my time. Why? Am I the only one? Why do we need a piece of paper to tell us that we are qualified for work? Aren't our skills enough? The system is flawed. Or something is wrong with it, or it's just me altogether...

I'm tired and sick. This is all...
