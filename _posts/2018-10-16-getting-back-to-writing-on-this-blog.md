## Hey there it's been a while

It's been almost 2 years since I've posted anything about something here. I'm not going to say that things are going to change, I've done that before and I let people down. I will however try and blog about all sorts of things, maybe redesign the site a bit (I've noticed some bugs on mobile).

## What I've been up to

The past 2 years have been quite the ride for me. Those who know me, know what I'm talking about, for those who don't maybe I'll write something about it later (not sure though).

I still enjoy photography, though I kinda left my DSLR and SLR behind and went fully mobile. First with my One Plus 3T phone, when I discovered it can shoot RAW images and I can edit them in Snapseed and now I've switched to the iPhone 8 Plus. The camera on the One Plus wasn't bad, but the videos from live events and concerts had unplayable audio. The videos on the iPhone are way, waaaay better. You can view some of the shots on my new instagram account: [roiadnb](www.instagram.com/roiadnb).

This is a good segway into the next thing I started. Last year around February I decided to start mixing Drum & Bass. I bought a [Numark Mixtrack Pro 3](https://www.numark.com/product/mixtrack-pro-3) and started practicing. Around August last year I landed my first gig and I've been having at least one gig every month since then. Mixing has been the most constant hobbie in my life so far. Sure I still enjoy photogaphy, but that went on the sideline.

Since I started mixing, I managed to have a weekly Drum & Bass show back in my town, on [Radio Arad 99.1 FM](http://tv-arad.ro/radio-arad/). Currently it's at Season 2 and you can listen to both seasons on my mixcloud page ([season 1](https://www.mixcloud.com/roia/playlists/nighty-night/) & [season 2](https://www.mixcloud.com/roia/playlists/nighty-night-season-2/)).

I've also started a page for my DJ-ing stuff. You can check it out [here](https://www.roiadnb.com).

I think that's about it. I'll drop some relevant links that you really need to check out:
* [RO/A Dnb Page](https://www.roiadnb.com)
* [RO/A Instagram](https://wwww.instagram.com/roiadnb)
* [RO/A YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/xblade981) - (my former Robert's Channel) I can't seem to update the link
