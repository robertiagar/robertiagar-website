I've been recently adding a lot to a set on my soundcloud page. Not sure if you guys have heard it, but these tunes help me stay focused. I know, you might be thinking how on earth can dubstep keep a man focus? It just works for me.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Honorable mentions:<br />  <br /><br />And let's not forget about my all time favorite, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/goingquantum">The Going Quantum Podcast</a>:<br /><br /><br />[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TcFWiFKDxI] Hope you enjoy this music as much me.
