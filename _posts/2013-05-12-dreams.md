<p>have you ever had a dream so real, that when you woke up you felt so weird that it nearly ruins you’re day? I’ve had. </p> <p>to be fair I rarely dream, but when I do my dreams are so vivid and real, I sometimes question what’s real and what’s not. the fact that they feel real it’s not what bothers me. what bothers me is what I dream. one way or another I dream something about her. I don’t mind it, but I dream she betrays me. why? why would my stupid subconscious thinks that she would do that.</p> <p>there is no reason she would. none at all. the weird part is what happened today. a name surfaced in my dream. she told it to me. today a phone call from a boy who once wanted her. his name was different.</p> <p>I hate coincidences, they freak me out. some a weird, some stupid. this was damn weird…</p> <p>oh well. I won’t bore you with the details. after all it’s 3 am…</p>
